        <h3>What is the Communicative Student Portal?</h3>
        <p>
            The Communicative Student Portal, also known as CSP, is an open-source "social media" portal which 
            is designed for students, teachers, and staff members of an university. 
        </p><br>
        <h3>Who are we?</h3>
        <p style="text-align:center">
            We are the three founders of the website, mistertfy64, Taweikung09, and Enchantingplayz.
        </p><br>
        <h3>Our goal?</h3>
        <p>
            Our goal is to make communication between memebers of the university secure and simple, allowing teachers
            to host educational content without fear of their content removed due to the social media's terms of service, 
            and promote learning for students.
